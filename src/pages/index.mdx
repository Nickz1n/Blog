### Technologies I master

- **Front-end**

   The visual part of websites and applications, that is, the area where users interact:

   ```js
   const structureWeb = Svelte
   const scriptWeb = TypeScript
   const API = GoLang

   const stylesheet = Tailwind
   const styleTheme = Bootstrap

   const framework = VueJS, Angular
   ```

- **Back-end**

  The logical part of a website, app or digital system, which works behind the scenes, ensuring everything works correctly:
  
   ```kotlin
   val bash = Git
   val dashboard = Dart
   var shoppingCart = PHP
   val storeGame = Java
   var raspBerry = Ruby
   ```

- **Database**
   ```bash
   pnpm MongoDB --dev --global MySQL -i Firebase
   ```

### Future Plans

- **Improve myself in Kotlin**.
- **Develop mobile applications**.
- **Work remotely from home**.
