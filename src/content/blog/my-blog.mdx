## Preface

I created this blog using Astro technology, and my main intention was to use `md` to facilitate posting and to be a static website, without needing depend on a backend.

## Main text

### Getting started

First you need to create an `mdx` file, which is as simple as changing the extension to `.mdx`.

### Introducing

The components provided by Astro are placed in the `/blog` and `/page` folders. Write something under the document properties (frontmatter):

```astro
import Collapse from "../../components/blog/collapse.astro"; import Diff from
"../../components/blog/diff.astro"; import Error from
"../../components/blog/error.astro"; import Info from
"../../components/blog/info.astro"; import Kbd from
"../../components/blog/kbd.astro"; import Success from
"../../components/blog/success.astro"; import Warning from
"../../components/blog/warning.astro"; import TimeLine from
"../../components/page/TimeLine.astro"; import LinkCard from
"../../components/page/LinkCard.astro";
```

### Example

#### Collapse

<Collapse title="This is an example text.">
  This is the hidden content!
</Collapse>

```astro
<Collapse title="This is an example text.">
  This is the hidden content!
</Collapse>
```
